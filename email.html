      <p class="lead">Not out of date. A great extension to your CRM.</p>

  <div class="long-content">
    <h2>eMail Marketing</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>eMail Marketing is alive and well, contrary to popular belief. Almost every CRM offers some type of eMail marketing platform.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The eMails are generally easy to build. The best part is, it is usually an interested audience; subscribers and existing customers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Who do we eMail?</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>If you don’t know it already, you should familiarize yourself with the “acres of diamonds.” This is your existing customer base and the people that subscribe to your eMails/Newsletter. You will eMail them promotions, sales, events, new products, webinars, whitepapers, etc.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>This is why having and maintaining a CRM is so important. Your CRM is your acres of diamonds and eMail marketing is how you will harvest those diamonds. Your CRM is more than a sales tool, it is a marketing tool.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>If you have a CRM:</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>If you have an existing CRM and you would like to start eMail marketing, MailChimp is a great way to get started.</p>
        <p> MailChimp can be connected to some CRM systems, making the use a lot easier. Additionally, it can be connected to other eCommerce services like Woo and Magento.</p>
        <p>This means that if your current CRM doesn't offer eMail marketing tools, you will be able to obtain them without finding a new CRM. Additionally, it is likely that MailChimp is less expensive than the add-ons your CRM is offering.</p>

    <h3>Building is cake:</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Building email campaigns is incredibly easy with their builder. Everything is click and drag. You can build modern HTML eMails with all of the analytics you expect, with absolutely no experience whatsoever.</p>
        <p>If you have ever worked with a click-and-drag web builder like Wix or Elementor, you will have no problem using Mail Chimps builder. Not only can you easily manage assets, icons for social links are already installed. </p>

    <h3>Reporting made easy:</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Reporting and tracking is also a piece of cake. Each campaign will report opens and clicks. However, note that Apple is making some changes to their built-in mail app, that will make tracking opens next to impossible. So, focus on clicks and conversions.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye on Decay Rate. Decay Rate is the rate at which people unsubscribe. Which is usually 30% annually. Meaning, you need to continually offer registration to new customers and run campaigns promoting your eMail marketing (newsletter).</p>
      </div>

    <h3>If you don't have a CRM:</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Without a CRM it is hard to keep track of your customers. Also, it is likely CRMs have been considered a tool of your sales team and not marketing. However, that changes with eMail marketing.</p>
        <p> If your company is large and you have deep pockets, something like SalesForce or Oracle might be a possibility. I have worked with and have experience with SalesForce and admit that their Marking Cloud is great to work with.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>However, those large CRMs can be intimidating and there are other options.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>If your organization doesn’t have that kind of cashflow, Hubspot is another great option. Hupspot is less expensive and has many similar features. In fact, some portions of it are completely free.</p>
        <img class="content-image-wide" src="images/HubSpotlogo.png" alt="hubspot logo">
        <p>Aside from having a great system and service, Hubspot leads the way in training. They offer online classes for almost everything related to digital marketing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>Hubspot isn’t and doesn’t need to be complicated. It is actually much user friendly that any other CRM you will find. You can expand and build your Hubspot service as your company grows.</p>
        <p>Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and CMS Hub can all work together as your needs expand.</p>
        <p>This is Hubspot’s market and where they really shine. Hubspot caters to the business that have teams and customers that need organization, but don’t have the size to justify $100,000 on a CRM like Salesforce.</p>
